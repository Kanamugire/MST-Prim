# MST-Prim
C++ implementation of Prim's algorithm for growing a Minimum Spanning Tree.
I originally started off by converting the pseudocode from the book,
"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leisserson, Rivest and Stein.

But as I continued on and on, implementing datatypes as required, I 
moved the steps from the core function into other functions, and played 
with some data structures like priority_queue and pairs of pairs to get
optimal performance, grouping and understandability.
These changes in no way changed the algorithm at heart, and works flawlessly
under every test case.
